# PlatePics
Hello, 


This project, PlatePics, is a starting website that is a mix between 
Yelp and Instagram. 

My goal is to have people upload pictures of what they eat and share recipes and restaurant recommendations. All while also being able to meet people in the area and find some "Plate Pals". 

This hopefully will also result in people showcasing their cooking skills, and might help some Chef's find jobs or get people more interested in cooking. 

Now to the "How" of the project: 

The index- main page - I want to use this as the main part of the site where all the uploaded pictures of the website can go so people can like the meals from others. 

The picture tab is created so liked pictured are stored for recipes/ restaurants/ etc so you can easily access it again, and the tool Plate of the week is so that there isn't a too dilluted pool of meals and people want to strive to take quality content. This could be potentially promising for businesses to promote their food, or even Chefs when they want to have a bigger following for their craft. 

The Recommendations I want to build upon the flavor profile of the account so if someone is vegan that it promotes vegan food, etc. I want to see if I can get OpenAI their API and have it shift through the images meta data so it can see what type of food it is and where it could be located so it promotes it for other people to get it(I want to also incorportate an opt-out for location for people who want to stay anonymous). 

The Location tab I want to use so that people can get food based on where they are located.I want to incorportate google maps API to have the map included so that people can search. With the addition that there are the popular plates (most liked) that get featured but also have a discovery section so that people can find less popular dishes. Hopefully with the discovery section I can create it based on flavor profile so it offers a better User Experience.

The Plate date is a play on words "play date" and I want to create an app that calculates the precentage of profile similarity so that people can meet spme new friends that have a similar flavor profile. 

Still need to find the best way to have a profile section and that you can also follow other people as well.
